# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

## Overview

Hi, I'm Nitin 👋

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!

This is a complete end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution. I built a modern data warehouse from scratch to process raw, disconnected CSV files into an actionable, interactive Business Intelligence dashboard..

## Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into PostgreSQL Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
